# US State Guessing Game

## Objective

Come on folks, lets check how many states you know in US. When you start to play a python turtle GUI[Graphical User Interface] will pop with a US state map image without the state names labeled on it. Here comes your challenge you have to guess the states name and score as much as you can and don't worry the names that you don't remember or don't familiar with are saved in an another `csv`[Comma Separated Values] file.


## Approach

1. **Installation and Setup:**

- The script requires turtle module to be installed. The `pip` command is used to install necessary libraries

## Setup

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install PythonTurtle
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use `python3` instead:
     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

2. **View the Output:**
   - The script will run and display the turtle `GUI`[Graphical User Interface] the results in the terminal.
